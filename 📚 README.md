## Templates

### Action Templates 

- [ ] Create SOPs for Actions

Actions are templates to enrich your artifacts.
- Folder: 0 Templates / Actions
- Syntax: `<Artifact_Type> Action <Source>`
>[!info] Following Templates are available:
>```query
>path: "0 Templates/Actions"
>```

#### Domain Action Alienvault
- API: https://otx.alienvault.com/api/v1/indicators/domain/'+input+'/geo

#### Domain Maltiverse 
- API: https://api.maltiverse.com/hostname/'+input

#### IP Action Multiverse
- API: https://api.maltiverse.com/ip/'+input)

### SOP Templates

- [ ] Write SOPs for all Artifact-Types
	- [ ] hash template has no content, header information can be used for new SOPs

>[!info] Following Templates are available:
>```query
>path: "0 Templates/SOPs"

# Obsidian Basics

## Internal Links

In general, internal links are surrounded by ` [[ ]] ` 

### Link to a file 

>[!Syntax]
> ``` [[üìö README]] ``` 

>[!Example]
>[[üìö README]]

### Link to a heading in a note

>[!Syntax]
> ``` [[üìö README#OZ Calendar]] ``` 

>[!Example]
> [[üìö README#OZ Calendar]]


### Link to a block in a note

Link to a text block  requires a block identifier. 
Fortunately, you don't need to know the identifier. When you type the caret (`^`), you can select the block from a list of suggestions to insert the right identifier.

>[!Syntax]
> in that case it is the text block of chapter [[üìö README#OZ Calendar|OZ Calendar]]:
> ``` [[üìö README#^363360]] ``` 

>[!Example]
> [[üìö README#^363360]]]

You can also create **human-readable block identifiers** by adding a blank space followed by the identifier, for example `^hotkey`, at the end of a block (e.g. chapter [[üìö README#Hotkeys|Hotkeys]])

>[!Syntax]
> in that case it is the table from chapter **Hotkeys**:
> ` [[üìö README#^hotkeys]] ` 
> or to make the link more readable:
> ` [[üìö README#^hotkeys|üîë Hotkeys]]` 

>[!Example]
> [[üìö README#^hotkeys]]
> or to make the link more readable:
> [[üìö README#^hotkeys|üîë Hotkeys]]

## Hotkeys

| Keys | Descritpion |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| ```[ALT]+[T]``` | Insert Current time 
| ```[ALT]+[D]``` | Insert current date 
| ```[ALT]+[E]``` | Open Insert Template modal
| ```[STRG]+[F]``` | Open search bar 
| ```[STRG]+[P]``` | Open command palette
| ```[STRG]+[O]``` | Open quick switcher (notes)
^hotkeys

## CSS Style Sheet

### CSS Snippet: obsidian-pagebreaks

Reference: https://gist.github.com/liamcain/81679412643690a7cdd13dff4dc909ce

Takes care of page breaks when exporting pdf files 

### CSS Snippet: multi columns

Reference: https://efemkay.github.io/obsidian-modular-css-layout/

#### CSS Snippet: wide view 

**css_class: wide-page**

the value _wide-page_ of cssclasses property will ignore **readable line length** in the editor settings.

**css_class: wide-dataview**

Affects only dataview outputs.

**css_class: wide-table**

Affects only tables.

**css_class: wide-callout**

Affects callouts only (e.g. below multi columns)

#### CSS Snippet: multi columns

That feature allows multiple lines within a note.

##### Page with 2 columns

>[!Syntax]
> ```
> > [!multi-column]
> >
> >> 1. column
> >
> >> 2. column
> ```

>[!Example]
>
>> [!multi-column]
>>
>>> 1. column
>>
>>> 2. column

##### Page with 3 columns

>[!Syntax]
> ```

> >> A hot dog is a dish consisting ...
> >
> >> [!help]- Dou you need help?
> >> Not what you are looking for? No worry! 
> >> ...
> >
> ```

>[!Example]
> > [!multi-column]
> >
> >> 1. column
> >>Hello World
> >>This text is too long for one column but line break is no magic and the callout will take care on that. Happy writing
> >
> >> # Hotdogs to go
> >> A hot dog is a dish consisting of a grilled, steamed, or boiled sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. The term hot dog can refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter W√ºrstchen, also just called frank). The names of these sausages commonly refer to their assembled dish. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide.
